# Template p5 project
WELCOME!!!

This is a series of particle simulations inspired by the prompt 'needy and clingy'. 
It's also inspired by the life cycle of a massive star. 

To engage with the project, begin by injecting mass by holding down the enter key, space bar, or your left mouse button.
Once the particles have fused sufficiently, they undergo collapse before going supernova. After a while, the supernova will collapse into a black hole.

This is version 1 and is still under minor construction...
